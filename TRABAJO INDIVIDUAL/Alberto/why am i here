Why did I choose to take this subject? 
Not only because it promises to be fun and dynamic, but because nowadays figuring out what you can do with a computer is essential. These machines have proved to be 
the most powerful tool to ever revolutionize science, and every year their potential is even bigger. Stubborn researchers burn their brains out trying to discover new 
computing possibilities, and their applications are responsible for all the scientific production of the last decades. 
The span of Bioinformatics is so massive this century that there is no single scientist who won’t ever need to print a few “Hello world!”s here and there. I know that 
I will face a computer in my future job, whether I want it or not. Then I consider it is better to get a little taste of bioinfo now rather than being traumatized by my 
PhD supervisor because I do not even know how to browse through directories from the terminal. To sum up, this is a train I do not want to miss… for my own sake.

(This first paragraph makes it seem as if I only want to take this subject because it is so uSeFuL but NO, the main reason is “I love bioinformatics because it’s FUN”). 
Some of the reasons I chose TAB and things I hope to learn while on it:

Knowing how to make computers do exactly what you want is refreshing.
Analyses need to be processed by a computer in order to be statistically powerful and reliable, there is no other option.
Alright, I got my experimental data! Now what? Bioinformatics or die.
Genetics is the biological sovereignty of big data, there is no way you can manage a genome if not using a computer.
Community work! It is possible to contribute to the global bunch through your own programmes thanks to online repositories such as Github. 
Fancy representation of your results in order to get published ($$$ :c )
Freedom and independence to manage and analyze your own data in a customized manner.
Also, a great learning outcome for my future prospects!
